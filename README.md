# Full Stack JavaScript Project 3

For this project, we had to add JavaScript to create functionality and interactivity with the HTML form.

## The Brief
In this project, you'll use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, you'll add your own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

## Exceeds Expectations
Real-time error message
On lines 157 - 169, I added an event listener for 'keyup' that will listen to any typing in the relevant fields and call the relevant functions from the event listeners.

Conditional error message
On lines 182 - 195, there are custom error messages that appear to enable the user to understand why their email input is or isn't working.

## Outcome
Everything is functioning as per the brief and exceeded grade requirements.
